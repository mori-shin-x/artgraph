## Purpose

This Skill inspects the project and reports a concise state summary: whether the artgraph CLI is installed, whether `.artgraph.json` and the trace lockfile exist, which SDD tools (Spec Kit, Kiro) have integration files, and which `artgraph-*` Skills are present under any of the project's canonical skills paths (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.kiro/skills/` — a project may have any subset, and multi-agent projects will often have several). This Skill itself is read-only and never writes to the project tree; however, the follow-up commands it recommends in Steps 4 and 5 DO modify files. Never execute those recommendations yourself — print them for the user, explain the caveats, and wait for explicit confirmation.

The steps below describe intent, not literal shell commands: compose each probe with your own shell's syntax (POSIX sh, PowerShell, ...) or your own file-inspection tools, whichever fits your environment.

## Steps

### 1. Check CLI availability

Probe whether the artgraph CLI is reachable. First try invoking the bare `artgraph` binary; if that is not on the PATH, try the package-runner forms that fit the project:

- `npx --no-install artgraph --version`
- `pnpm exec artgraph --version`
- `bunx --no-install artgraph --version`
- `deno run -A npm:artgraph/cli --version`

Prefer the flagged variants (`--no-install`) so the probe fails cleanly on missing installs instead of silently fetching artgraph and mutating the runner's package cache. If a probe requires an install-triggering fallback (e.g. older Bun without `--no-install`, or Deno, which has no equivalent flag), skip it and try the next probe rather than let the "read-only" contract of this Skill slip. If none of these succeeds, report `artgraph CLI not installed` and recommend the `artgraph-setup` Skill. Continue with the remaining inspection steps regardless — they remain useful without the CLI.

### 2. Check `.artgraph.json`

Check whether a `.artgraph.json` file exists at the project root; report `config: present` or `config: missing` accordingly. If present, report the lockfile path declared in the config (default `.trace.lock`) and whether that file exists on disk.

### 3. Check SDD-tool integrations

Check for the integration markers:

- the directory `.specify/extensions/artgraph/` exists -> Spec Kit integrated
- the file `.kiro/steering/artgraph.md` exists -> Kiro integrated

Also check for the tool markers themselves, to distinguish "tool not present" from "tool present but not integrated":

- `.specify/` exists -> Spec Kit detected
- `.kiro/` exists -> Kiro detected

Derive the Step 5 tri-state per tool: integration marker present → `yes`; only the tool marker present → `no`; neither present → `not-detected`. (The integration marker lives inside the tool marker's directory tree, so `yes` implies detected — the fourth combination is physically impossible.)

### 4. Check installed Skills

Enumerate all five canonical skills paths — each one maps to a fixed `--agents` id: `.claude/skills/` -> `claude`, `.agents/skills/` -> `codex`, `.cursor/skills/` -> `cursor`, `.github/skills/` -> `copilot`, `.kiro/skills/` -> `kiro`. For each path, treat it as a "qualifying artgraph skills path" only when BOTH of the following hold:

- the directory itself exists on disk, AND
- it contains at least one `artgraph-<name>/SKILL.md` file (a bare-empty directory, or a directory created by an unrelated tool with the same name and no SKILL.md inside, does NOT count).

Under each qualifying path, list the subdirectories whose names start with `artgraph-` and which contain a `SKILL.md`. Compare that list against the canonical set: `artgraph-coverage`, `artgraph-detect`, `artgraph-impact`, `artgraph-integrate`, `artgraph-plan-coverage`, `artgraph-rename`, `artgraph-setup`, `artgraph-verify`. If NO canonical path qualifies, report that no artgraph Skills are distributed anywhere in this project and skip the reinstall recommendation below — instead route the user to the "next steps" branch in Step 5 for that case.

If at least one path qualifies but some canonical Skills are missing (the user ran `init --minimal` or `--no-skills`, or deleted Skills manually), recommend the **Skills-only** reinstall form:

```
<PM-exec> init --minimal --with-skills --agents=<detected> --force
```

where:

- `<PM-exec>` is the project's package runner (`npx artgraph` / `pnpm exec artgraph` / `bunx artgraph` / `deno run -A npm:artgraph/cli`) — prefer the same runner that succeeded in Step 1.
- `<detected>` is the comma-separated list of agent ids corresponding to the qualifying paths above (lowercase, no trailing comma, no empty elements, no duplicate ids; order and case do not matter — the CLI normalizes them). Example: `claude,cursor` if both `.claude/skills/` and `.cursor/skills/` qualified.
- `--minimal --with-skills` restricts the run to the Skills stage only, so `.artgraph.json`, `.trace.lock`, SDD-tool integration files, the Stop hook, and the AGENTS.md wrapper are left untouched.
- `--force` overwrites drift — including any local edits under `<agent_skills_path>/artgraph-*/SKILL.md`.

**Caveats to relay to the user verbatim before they run it:**

- This command overwrites every `SKILL.md` under the selected agents' skills paths, and regenerates each path's `.gitattributes` (LF pin). Any local edits to those files will be replaced with the canonical templates.
- Advise the user to run `git status` (and `git stash` if there are pending edits) beforehand so they can review or preserve local changes.
- If only a subset of paths needs reinstalling (e.g. only `.cursor/skills/` fell out of sync), narrow `<detected>` to that subset — the caveats above still apply within the selected scope, but untouched agent paths stay bit-exact as they are.
- **Do NOT execute this command yourself.** Print it, explain the caveats, and wait for the user's explicit confirmation.

Only if the user explicitly asks to also re-provision `.artgraph.json`, `.trace.lock`, integration files, hooks, and the AGENTS.md wrapper, drop `--minimal --with-skills`. That default-mode variant additionally rewrites `.artgraph.json` (existing custom fields are preserved on merge, but `packageManager` is refreshed from current project state), re-scans and rewrites `.trace.lock`, overwrites Kiro `.kiro/steering/artgraph.md` and Spec Kit `.specify/extensions/artgraph/**` (including any manually tuned hook entries in `.specify/extensions.yml`), and refreshes the AGENTS.md wrapper's marker block (user content outside the marker is preserved). An existing `.claude/settings.json` Stop hook is NEVER overwritten, even with `--force` — that is a hard invariant of the `--force` contract.

### 5. Summarize

Print a 4-line summary like:

```
artgraph: installed | not installed
config: present | missing
integrations: speckit=[yes/no/not-detected] kiro=[yes/no/not-detected]
skills: N of 8 installed (paths: <skills dirs found>; missing: <list>)
```

Suggest next steps based on what's missing, in this priority order:

- **CLI not installed** → invoke `artgraph-setup` (fresh install).
- **SDD tools present but not yet integrated** → invoke `artgraph-integrate`.
- **Some canonical Skills absent AND at least one skills path qualified in Step 4** → recommend the Skills-only reinstall command from Step 4 (`<PM-exec> init --minimal --with-skills --agents=<detected> --force`). Print it, relay the Step 4 caveats, and wait for the user's explicit confirmation. Do NOT execute it yourself.
- **Some canonical Skills absent AND NO skills path qualified in Step 4** (i.e. `<detected>` would be empty) → invoke `artgraph-setup` instead. Do NOT emit `--agents=<detected>` in this case — the CLI rejects an empty `--agents=` list (`ERROR: --agents=<list> requires at least one non-empty value`) and `artgraph-setup` is the correct entry point when nothing is distributed yet.
